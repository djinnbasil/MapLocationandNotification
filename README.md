# MapLocationandNotification
I have made an app to display map and you can search for location using the AutoComplete Fragment. And I have also used the google maps api to get the best place of interest. It picks out the best place of interest based on grouped rating in the api for places of interest. And the best place of interest is shown to you in a notification.

I have also added the screenshots to the main directory of the commit in case the Issue called "Screenshots" cannot be accessed.

Implemented BioMetric Login,Maps, AutoComplete Fragment for location ,Places of Interest API and Notification.
